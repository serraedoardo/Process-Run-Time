# Process-Run-Time
Python script that can monitor any process run time on Windows.

Rename "DCS Run Time.bat" as you wish or leave it as is. Inside elapsed_time.pyw rename "DCS.exe" with whatever process you want to monitor. Create a shortcut for "DCS Run Time.bat" and put it inside "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup", reboot the system and the script should now be running fine.
