# Process-Run-Time
Python script that can monitor any process run time on Windows.

Rename "DCS Run Time.bat" as you wish or leave it as is. Edit the .bat file with the correct path for both your python installation and the path to the folder where elapsed_time.pyw is located. Inside elapsed_time.pyw rename "DCS.exe" with whatever process you want to monitor. Create a shortcut for "DCS Run Time.bat" and put it inside "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup", reboot the system and the script should now be running fine.
